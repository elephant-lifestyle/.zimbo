	<h1> <center><u>ELEPHANT - COMMISSION</u></center></h1>
<P>You earn <STRONG>COMMISSION</STRONG> on every purchase made by your down liner down to the 3rd level <br>depending on your discount level status. Commission, promotion and bonuses are calculated on PV.
	<p></p>
The compensation plan is generous on unlimited width on recruits meaning <br>you can have many direct recruits as many as you want but limited on depth to 3rd level generation.<p></p>
The diagram below shows (YOU) on black, your 1st Level down liner <br>represented by blue colour, your 2nd level down liner in green and your 3rd level downline in red. <p></p>

<p></p>
In order to qualify for commission a member is supposed to be active<br> that month by purchasing a minimum of 1600pv on his/her Personal account. <p></p>

ELEPHANT commission is calculated and payed in USD or converted to <br>local currency and payed in cash or deposited direct to your bank account or mobile phone through Mukuru.<p></p>

You earn 10% of your 1st level down liner PV divided by 100 =USD. <p></p>

For example, letâ€™s say your 1st level down liner purchased 30 000 personal<br> pv you benefit 10% of 30 000 divided by 100 =$30 USD commission payed to you that month. <p></p>

You also earn 7% of your 2nd generation and 5% of your 3rd generation. E.g.<br> Let us say you have recruited 4 members as your first level, then your first level recruited<br> 4 people each, then your 3rd level also did the same as shown in the diagram below.
